# ETL_Project

## **E**xtract

My data sources were taken from Kaggle.com and Data.gov.  The Kaggle.com file is an SQLite database that contains two tables: NationalNames and StateNames.  I was focused on the NationalNames table, which provided data from 1880-2014 on baby names, and the count of babies in the United States named each specific name by year. The Data.gov file is a CSV that contains similar information, but specific to New York City from 2011-2016.  These data resources were too large to upload through GitHub. To view these sources, please go to:

- https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names#database.sqlite for the US Baby names SQLite database.

- https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/most-popular-baby-names-by-sex-and-mothers-ethnic-group-new-york-city-8c742 for the NYC Baby Names CSV file.
